Walmart Eco-Pack AI: An intelligent solution designed to help Walmart achieve its ambitious 2025 sustainability goals by optimizing e-commerce packaging.

This AI-powered tool automatically calculates the most efficient box dimensions for single and multi-item orders, significantly reducing "shipping air" and associated logistics costs. Simultaneously, it recommends the most sustainable packaging materials based on factors like recycled content, recyclability, biodegradability, and carbon footprint.

Key Features:
- **Smart Box Sizing:** Dynamically determines optimal package dimensions to minimize volume and material use.
- **Sustainable Material Recommendation:** Leverages AI to suggest eco-friendly packaging options tailored to product fragility and sustainability metrics.
- **Real-time Impact Assessment:** Provides clear metrics on potential volume reduction, CO2 emissions avoided, and increase in recycled content.
- **Directly Addresses Walmart's 2025 Goals:** Aims to reverse virgin plastic usage increases and accelerate progress towards 100% recyclable/reusable/compostable private brand packaging.

Developed for the Walmart Sparklathon, this prototype demonstrates a scalable and impactful approach to making Walmart's operations greener and more cost-efficient.
